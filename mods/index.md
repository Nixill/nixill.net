I make mods for [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/)! On this page you can see some of what I've done.


# Content mods
These mods add new gameplay content or mechanics! Most players will probably be interested in these.

## Switcheroo
Switcheroo randomly changes every item of yours every floor.

It's my first mod, dating back to when Synchrony was just a fan-made unofficial client.

## Lola
Lola is a character who can't directly pick up items, but has to open chests and leave the items sitting on the floor to receive them.

This is my most complete mod, a fun character idea I'd had when I thought "What if we had a character forced to play low%?".

# Library mods
These mods add functions that other mods can use. Most players will probably barely know these are here, but other developers may be interested in them.

## NixLib
NixLib is simply a library of functions and minor components that I don't want to keep redefining in every mod I make.

## Power Settings
Power Settings is a library mod that overhauls Synchrony's own Settings API to add additional features and settings types.
