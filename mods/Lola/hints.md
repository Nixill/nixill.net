These are some ideas from the mod's creator. (If anyone else contributes ideas, they'll be listed here too!)

# Avoiding unwanted items
There are several ways to avoid unwanted items:
- Another player can pick them up, if there are others. Even if they put it back down, the item becomes unclaimed.
- You can use a bomb, including from a bomb trap or bomber goblin, to destroy it.
- The Package spell can be used to hide items. Then just don't re-open the crate.
- Taking a pitfall trap or cracked floor bypasses item pickups. So does running out the song.

# Bypass bosses!
If you find the Ring of Mana, the Package Spell can be used on enemies. Try it on a boss!
