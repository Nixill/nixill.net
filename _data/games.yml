      It's fun to play it with your music and get high scores. It's also
      a good way to show off original music, as [WinnerBit](https://twitch.tv/WinnerBit)
      has shown off.
    minus: |
      It doesn't really have much going for it otherwise. Also, when
      streaming it, you have to be mindful of copyright, as it only
      has one song of its own.

      I like the graphics pulsing in time to the music as well as how it
      determines the power of your own bullets, and "Open Mic" mode is a
      really good addition given how widespread streaming services where
      you don't actually download the music have become.
    minus: |
      It's a difficult game; I frequently find myself unable to complete
      tracks, though that might be more the fact I'm not great with this
      style of game. It's also not super great for streaming because of
      copyright laws.

      It's a neat genre fusion I don't think I've seen before: A rhythm
      game for combat in what's otherwise a light RPG. I enjoyed its story.
    minus: |
      The chance of failure to craft and the random loot drops feel like
      unnecessary padding. It got so bad at one point that there is
      actually [a highlight](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/518652157)
      (note: strong language) of my reaction to the imbalance.

    I didn't use that above.
  review:
    plus: |
      I was already a fan of both NecroDancer and Zelda (admittedly more
      the former) before this came out, so this was a welcome crossover to
      see. It contained some welcome quality-of-life changes to
      NecroDancer, including offering the option to play any character
      without rhythm three years before NecroDancer itself offered that
      same option, and the fact that (by default) it's not one life or
      start over.
    minus: |
      Runs are a bit long. NecroDancer's any% (default character) world
      record is about 5½ minutes, whereas Cadence of Hyrule's is almost
      triple that. It also features NecroDancer's usual difficulty, albeit
      with some mitigating factors like the aforementioned fixed-beat mode
      and multiple attempts.

      I'm not all that great at city-building games, but this manages to
      strike the right chord with me because of its mod support and
      out-of-the-box sandbox/creative mode.
    minus: |
      As I said, I'm not all that great at city-building games, so I
      haven't really been able to play this unmodded. Additionally, some
      mods that feel "necessary" add a lot of overhead and significantly
      slow down the game. Maybe one day I'll have another go at it, but I
      don't think I'll do that great.

      For some reason I've mentally associated this game's 2015 release
      with the uproar about the always-online DRM in EA's 2013 "SimCity",
      and this game being a more positive answer to that.

      I *am*, however, excited for its sequel.

      I received the Synchrony DLC for this game for free. My name is also
      in the credits, in the "Synchrony Testers" section near the end.
  notes: |
    The Humble Store only has the base game. However, you can buy the base
    game there and then redeem the Steam key and buy the DLCs on Steam.
    Additionally, the Synchrony DLC is currently only available for PC.
  review:
    plus: |
      I enjoy the fusion of turn-based dungeon crawler and rhythm game,
      especially in the fact that adding a time limit to all the turns
      means it's possible to make a turn-based game where dodging all
      attacks is technically possible still be decently skill-based. It
      feels difficult but fair once you get used to it.
    minus: |
      There is a lot of information to take in all at once, which isn't
      exactly my strongest suit. Some characters I'm good at, but most I'm
      not without mods, and there are a couple characters I just can't
      play on my current hardware. Also I'm not a super big fan of mod
      support and online multiplayer being locked behind a DLC.
    more: |
      I actually got this game on the recommendation of another content
      creator, Nerd³, who [played it in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCG4IcBJTOE).
      Also, the Synchrony DLC was originally a fan-made alternative client
      for the game (that particular fan is actually the lead dev on the
      DLC), and I've written several thousand lines of code in mods for
      it. It's the only game in my Steam library (so far) in which I've
      reached 700, 1000, or 2500 hours, and was the first for which I even
      hit 500 hours.

      I'm a big fan of the *idea* of this game. Web-swinging parkour is
      just plain fun, and for the most part I'm happy with the physics
      engine here too. Most levels are easy to *beat*, but decently
      challenging to get three-star times on. I also enjoyed its soundtrack.
    minus: |
      Some levels I've thrown dozens of attempts at and haven't managed to
      beat at all. It's only thanks to a glitch in the game that I've
      actually been able to attempt *all* of the levels. Additionally, it
      hasn't received some upkeep that was apparently needed, and (as of
      2023 Sep 27) the monthly and full-game marathon modes have not
      worked in months (despite the fact that full-game marathon mode
      shouldn't even need to change month to month).

      This game about riding a bike down a mountain contains a lot of the
      things I like about roguelikes - randomly generated hills, limited
      health before you have to start over, randomly selected upgrades
      that you can earn, a "boss fight" at the end of each region, and a
      slight emphasis on getting through the whole thing as fast as you
      can.
    minus: |
      Some of the controls are tight and it doesn't always feel fair when
      you fall off your bike or do/don't get a "Clean Landing". I haven't
      managed to speed through it yet, though I did manage to clear both
      Campaign and Campaign-Plus with a lot of farming health in the first
      region.

      It's got a really cool GP system where each racer starts each race
      "at speed", as far behind or ahead as they finished the last race —
      so whoever has the shortest *sum of times* across all the races will
      win the whole GP, regardless of performance on individual races.
      It's a system I wish more racing games had.

      It doesn't have the greatest physics engine, and the AI quickly
      ramps up to levels that don't forgive mistakes. I did not manage to

    plus: |
      The team at SCS have put over a decade of work into this game and it
      shows in how detailed all the scenery is throughout the scaled-down
      model of Europe. The fact that, at the end of the day, it is just a
      videogame also helps me get a lot more into this than I ever could
      driving a real car, given my disabilities of attention and memory
      that make driving a stressful and dangerous undertaking.
    minus: |
      Even though it's scaled down, some journeys in the game can still
      take hours of real-life time, and it's not that great for
      multitasking. I'm also not a fan of some of the achievements, like
      one for exploring 100% of the map, which has no room for error or
      game updates (any bit of road that changes in an update becomes
      unexplored); or some other achievements that require you to do all
      of a certain thing but don't have any in-game progress tracker to
      tell you which ones you've done or not.
    # Old review that I don't want to just lose:
    #
    # Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game about driving simulated trucks
    # through a scaled-down copy of Europe. You need to pick up trailers at
    # one warehouse, actually drive by the rules of the road even across
    # borders, and back it into another warehouse that's probably two
    # countries over.
    #
    # I frequently describe myself as someone who has disabilities of memory
    # and attention that make it unsafe to operate a motor vehicle. I'm also
    # aware of this at all moments *during* the operation of a motor
    # vehicle, making it extremely stressful to do.
    #
    # Sounds like a match made in Hell, right? Somehow, ETS2 makes it work,
    # to the point that it was the chief driving factor behind my decision
    # to get a racing wheel and pedals. That's probably down to all the
    # options it gives you to customize gameplay, and the fact that at the
    # end of the day, it is just a game. Head-on collision with another
    # driver at 300 relative kilometers an hour? Pay the fine for causing a
    # crash, get repaired at services, and you're on your way again. Don't
    # want to be fined for causing crashes? Turn it off in the options!
    # Don't want to drive at night? Find a parking lot and hit a button to
    # skip eight hours in about three seconds! Don't feel like driving any
    # more even though you're an entire megameter away from where you
    # started? Close the game anyway!
    #
    # ETS2 also has a robust physics engine (until you break it anyway),
    # and a beautifully rendered continent that the team at SCS have
    # lovingly worked on for years. It and its sister game American Truck
    # Simulator go to great lengths to mimic actual interchanges and street
    # layouts, and all the trucks in both games are actual truck brands.
    # There are many reasons it has several hundred hours in my Steam library.

      Hades is faithful to most aspects of Greek mythology (barring a
      couple details of the family tree that would be less pleasant to
      a general audience) while creating a new story to wrap things up in
      a happier ending, and it does so with a very well-built roguelike to
      ascend through the levels of the titular underworld.
    minus: |
      It's kind of a long story. Then, once you finish it, you can never
      reach the most beautiful area in the game ever again; it simply gets
      written out with a flimsy narration excuse each time you try. It's
      not exactly plot holes, but it just feels hollow when everything
      else is so well written.

      "The floor is lava" is a classic children's game about jumping all
      over the furniture and trying to avoid touching the floor. This game
      takes that concept and adds in toys with extra abilities like a
      double jump or slide, with a physics engine that feels fun to run in.
    minus: |
      "School", the first world that was created (now the third in the
      game's order), has levels that are a lot longer than in the rest of
      the game. Plus, levels in the first six worlds were all made when
      only the Boost Jump ability existed and weren't changed for the
      addition of the other abilities (though there *are* separate
      leaderboards) - for Master Class in particular, these levels were
      actually designed around *using* the Boost Jump and can be quite
      difficult if you have a different ability equipped.

      And despite all of the above, the game hasn't precisely "clicked"
      with me since in the end grinding for good times isn't exactly my
      best idea of a good time.

      Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun little racing game. It doesn't contain

      some good progression and fair goals (at least for general
      completion), while the single-race modes are easy to get to and play.
    minus: |
      Some of the time trial times are extremely tight, and the game
      features a loot-box system (even if it's not a real money paid one)

      Hot Wheels: Velocity X breaks from the traditional Hot Wheels racing
      formula by actually adding missions of varying objectives, such as
      battles or retrieval or even, at one point, defending an innocent.
      There are pickups and all sorts of cars, and even cheats are
      available in-game for your use.
    minus: |
      You can tell it's a dated game with nowhere near modern graphics or
      physics. I've also never managed to finish it, even with all the
      cheats enabled, though I don't remember if that's from lack of skill
      or lack of interest (or a combination of the two).

    Purchase links have been skipped above as there are far too many

    from the first three packs.

    plus: |
      Jackbox Party Pack games are easy to set up and host, and good for
      streams because only one person actually needs to own the game for
      everyone to join. Across all the packs, there's a decent variety of
      games, so you can be sure you'll have something for everyone... if
      you've purchased the right packs, that is.
    minus: |
      The games being split up into so many paid packs isn't the best
      model, especially with only the later packs receiving general QoL
      updates like code hiding or moderation features. It's a good way to
      ensure that they'll keep getting money, sure. Also, I'm not great at
      social or comedy games, so a lot of these are hard for me to host in
      particular.

    It might be prudent to note that, at least on the Humble Store, the
    "XXL Edition", available [here](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/just-cause-3-xxl-edition?partner=nixill&charity=1599605),
    offers over a 50% discount as compared to the price of buying the game
    and its DLCs individually.

      Just Cause 3 is a game about deposing a dictator through the liberal
      use of explosions, a wingsuit, and a grappling hook. The story is a
      bit dark, though it doesn't go too far for my own tastes. 
    minus: |
      Movement is a bit sticky and tough, especially after having played
      its sequel already. The dark story might also turn other people away.

      It's a good first entry into the Zelda franchise, as it was for me.
      I also like how it makes use of the touch screen without seeming
      particularly overbearing about it.
    minus: |
      Some puzzles are super tight and not always as clear as they need to
      be, and I don't like how you can't just "free sail" (you have to
      plan a path in advance and follow it) over the seas.

      Spirit Tracks is the sequel to Phantom Hourglass, and is in fact the
      second Legend of Zelda game I owned. It fixes a complaint I
      mentioned in the Phantom Hourglass review - unlike in that game, in
      this one you *can* just get moving in the overworld without a
      pre-planned path. I also liked the story to this one.
    minus: |
      Some of the enemy trains seem a little unfair sometimes, especially
      the fact that contact is an instant game-over rather than a health
      loss like other obstacles are. Also, the flute-playing is rather
      difficult and there isn't usually a way around using the microphone.
