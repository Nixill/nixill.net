Lola is a character who is bound by a curse to not directly take actions that would break Low Percent (picking up items or using shrines). They must instead reveal the items, then leave them on the floor, and take the stairs to receive them.

The pages on this site are updated for version **1.4.2** of Lola. As of this writing, **1.3.1** is the latest console-approved version. You can view the changelogs [here](changelogs.md).

# How to play
The following assumes you're playing with Default Rules. There are also [Classic Rules](options.md#classic-rules), or [Options](options.md) to customize your experience.

There are five simple steps that are explained in further detail on the rest of this page:

1. [Low% rules apply.](#low-rules-apply)
2. [Reveal items from chests.](#reveal-items-from-chests)
3. [Claim items on stairs.](#claim-items-on-stairs)
4. [Track your times.](#track-your-times)
5. [Earn achievements.](#earn-achievements)

## Low% rules apply.
Lola will instantly die if they directly attempt to pick up any item or use any shrine. To mark this, those items are red or shrines purple.

However:
- If Lola drops or throws an item, they may retrieve it without dying.
- If Lola breaks a Glass Shovel or a Glass weapon, they may pick up its shard without dying.
- Lola may cause the Shrines of Fire, Pain, Sacrifice, and the Feast to become activated. Picking up their rewards, however, is still deadly.
- Lola may pick up a Golden Lute. This doesn't break low% for vanilla characters (as it's a requirement for Cadence to be able to finish a run).
- For balance reasons, Lola may directly pick up Potions without any special handling.

Items that are safe for Lola to directly pick up are outlined in blue.

## Reveal items from chests.
Lola will get to keep any items they reveal (from a crate, chest, etc.) as long as the items are still on the ground at the end of the floor.

An item can count as revealed if it comes from...
- A chest
- A crate or barrel
- A shrine (explosion or activation)
- A shopkeeper (killed)
- Leprechaun or Thief
- A chest, crate, barrel, or shrine Mimic (killed)
- The peaceful gargoyles in Zone 4
- A Conjurer or Transmogrifier purchase
- A Pawnbroker Trade Offer or Special Offer

So long as either...
- Lola opened the storage or killed the enemy that contained the item.
- Lola made the purchase or sale that resulted in the item spawning.
- Lola was the last player that touched the storage or enemy that contained the item, before it was opened or killed by environmental damage.

A green outline means Lola has claimed that item. A yellow outline means Lola has claimed the item, but it's one of a group of items, only one of which will actually be received. And, in multiplayer, a grey outline means a different Lola has claimed the item.

An item is not claimed in this way if it could be directly picked up instead. If an item has a blue outline, it is safe to directly pick up.

Items get unclaimed if any player picks them up or they get packaged.

## Claim items on stairs.
To actually receive claimed items, Lola **must** take the stairs. In multiplayer, dying also works. Any other method of exiting the floor (trapdoor, song end) skips item retrieval.

This was designed to be consistent with Monk's rules of coin retrieval; however, "can collect items on death" was added for balance purposes (and can be turned off in the options).

## Track your times.
Lola offers simple tracking of your best times in various modes, more specifically...

- Any of...
  - Default Rules
  - Classic Rules
  - Default Rules with Lute
- ... combined with any combination (or none) of...
  - No Rejects (finish the run without skipping claiming any revealed items)
  - Mystery Mode (use the Mystery Mode extra mode)
- ... and played on...
  - Regular rhythm
  - No Beat Mode (v1.4.0+)

These times can be viewed under Options → Mod Options → Lola → Best Times (Lola). You can also disable saving them.

## Earn achievements.
*(Note: To earn achievements, the [In-Game Achievements](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/ingameachievements) mod is required and must be enabled.)*

For successfully finishing a singleplayer run under Default Rules, you'll earn the achievement "Lola the Lucky".

For successfully finishing a singleplayer run under [Classic Rules](options.md#classic-rules), you'll earn the achievement "Lola the Persistent".

For successfully finishing a singleplayer run under either preset, **without rejecting any revealed items**, you'll earn the achievement "Lola the Adaptible".

Note that Phasing Mode and Dance Pad Mode must be disabled to earn these achievements. Before version 1.4.0, No Beat mode must also be disabled.
