Health × Floor is a mod that multiplies every enemy's base health by the current floor. Good luck!

Enemies that don't normally take knockback have it added if:
- The enemy is knockbackable at all.
- The enemy's normal max health is 1.
- The enemy moves every beat.
- The enemy doesn't have a pattern-based AI (like slimes), a charge (like minotaurs), or a turn delay on changing facing direction (like orcs).

This page is updated for version **1.0.0** of HTF. As of this writing, there is no console-approved version.

# Options
There is one option in the Custom Rules. The "Training health factor" option lets you multiply the enemy's health by a number of your choice on training floors. It also affects the tutorial level. It defaults to 1, and can be set up to 50. And it does not affect any regular gameplay.
