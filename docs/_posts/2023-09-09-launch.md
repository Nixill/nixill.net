You've found my website! I've decided to try out the whole web presence and blogging thing. I hope it's as cozy to you as it is to me. There's an RSS feed if you'd like to follow my posts.

You can expect to find major streaming updates, excerpts of my code, updates and help guides to the mods and discord bots I'm making, some samples of my photography, or just general ramblings, including such topics as transit. I might even write some sort of stories.

I have ADHD, so don't expect any sort of general schedule. I'm also not what I would call the greatest writer in the world, though I'm hoping to improve that with this project. Some posts may occasionally be in German as part of an attempt to learn the language.

Parts of the website are still under construction, but I'm putting it out now to be ready for my trip on Monday.
