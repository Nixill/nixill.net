How Batty! is a mod that changes every enemy's AI to bat-random. Even shopkeepers!

{% include image.html url="HowBattyBanner.png" alt="Banner for How Batty, showing a shopkeeper attacking a player, which is captioned &quot;Always roll the shopkeepers.&quot;" caption="Not intended as actual advice." %}

It also removes Luck immunity to bat attacks! Shopkeepers are excluded from this removal, though.

This page is updated for version **1.0.0** of HTF. As of this writing, there is no console-approved version.

# Options
There is one option in the Custom Rules. The "Remove luck" option can be turned off to make a Lucky Charm basically break the game (making you immune to any enemy that has another place it can go).
