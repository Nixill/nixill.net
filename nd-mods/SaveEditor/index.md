Save Editor can be used to modify singleplayer single-zones and lobby progression.

The current version on PC is **1.1.1**. There is no version approved for consoles.

# How to use
To use the mod, open the pause menu in the singleplayer lobby, and then select the Save Editor option. You'll then be presented with a menu with the following options:

- **Playable characters:** This menu lets you unlock (or lock) playable characters, and set how many zones you've cleared with those characters.
- **Lobby NPCs:** This menu lets you free lobby NPCs from the various zones in the crypt (or lock them back up).
- **Permanent upgrades:** This menu lets you unlock the Dungeon Master's permanent upgrades.
- **Unlocked single-zone items:** This menu lets you purchase the items from Merlin and Hephaestus.
- **Enemies for training:** This menu lets you unlock enemies to train against in the Beastmaster or Bossmaster.
- **Used items:** This menu lets you unmark the diamond piles as collected, or mark weapons as used for training in the Weaponmaster.
- **Extra modes:** This menu lets you unlock the Extra Modes menu or the Level Editor.

Once you close the menu, the lobby will restart automatically.
