I make mods for [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/)! On this page you can see some of what I've done.


# Content mods
These mods add new gameplay content or mechanics! Most players will probably be interested in these.

## Health Times Floor
Health Times Floor is a simple mod that just multiplies every enemy's base health by the current floor.

I made it when [Infinite Slot Capacity](https://mod.io/g/crypt/m/infiniteslotcapacity) was first released, to give myself a bigger challenge against it.

As of the latest website update, the latest mod version on PC is **1.0.0**. It is not yet approved on consoles.

## How Batty!
How Batty! is a simple mod that changes every enemy's AI to bat.

I just figured I could. :)

As of the latest website update, the latest mod version on PC is **1.0.0**. It is not yet approved on consoles.

## LobbyJukebox
LobbyJukebox is a mod that adds a jukebox to the lobby to play the game's music.

This one, I made because I wanted to have background music for mod-coding streams that isn't just "the game's lobby music on eternal loop", but that automatically switches to game music when I start playing to test.

It has also been used to provide background music to competitive necrodancer events.

The current version is **1.0.3**. There is no version approved for consoles.

## Lola
Lola is a character who can't directly pick up items, but has to open chests and leave the items sitting on the floor to receive them.

This is my most complete mod, a fun character idea I'd had when I thought "What if we had a character forced to play low%?".

As of the latest website update, the latest mod version on PC is **1.4.1**, and the latest mod version on consoles is **1.3.1**.

[WinnerBit](https://bsky.app/profile/twistbit.cc) did the artwork for this mod!

Version **1.3.1** of this mod was featured in Week 39 of the Weekly Challenge.

## Switcheroo
Switcheroo randomly changes every item of yours every floor.

It's my first mod, dating back to when Synchrony was just a fan-made unofficial client.

# Library mods
These mods add functions that other mods can use. Most players will probably barely know these are here, but other developers may be interested in them.

## NixLib
NixLib is simply a library of functions and minor components that I don't want to keep redefining in every mod I make.

## Power Settings
Power Settings is a library mod that overhauls Synchrony's own Settings API to add additional features and settings types.
