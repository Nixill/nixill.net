# Chat rules
Please adhere to the following rules when chatting:

1. **Don't be a dick.** Hatred toward marginalized groups is absolutely NOT okay, and bad news can usually wait until after the stream.
2. **Don't link stuff without asking.** However, sharing clips of my current stream or anyone I'm streaming with is encouraged.
3. **Swearing in moderation is okay,** but any sexual content is not.
4. **I trust my mods,** and it will be extremely rare if ever that I overturn their decisions. Don't argue with or ignore them.
5. **Stick to English.** I'm learning German but can't read it on the fly during streams, and don't know any other languages.
6. **PLEASE mention technical issues!** I can't fix them if I don't know they're happening. This includes things like the UI buttons showing up in my "webcam", lack of game audio, or other technical errors.
7. **Please don't mention the viewer count.** I've hidden it from my views on purpose. I'll take a look after the stream.

I will not be impressed by attempts to find loopholes or edge cases to these rules, and reserve the right to be more or less lenient on them on a person-by-person or case-by-case basis.

## German streams
The following additional rules apply when I'm playing a game in German and translating it for stream:

1. **Don't translate it for me.** I want to try and translate it on my own first. Once I have, you can critique or correct my translations.
2. **Don't use online translation.** Please only offer critique if you actually know (or are learning) German yourself.
3. **The English source material is irrelevant.** There is no guarantee that the German localization is intended to be identical in meaning to the English.
4. **German is allowed in chat,** but expect me to be slow to acknowledge it and I will likely reply in English.
